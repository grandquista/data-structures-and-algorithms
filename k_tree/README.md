# Implement a k tree
Create a Python class that implements the methods of a k tree algorithm.

## Challenge
Implement the following methods.

- `insert` inserting the value into the tree under a given parent node
- `preOrder` iterate through the tree calling visitor on pre order
- `postOrder` iterate through the tree calling visitor on post order
- `breadthFirst` iterate through the tree calling visitor on breadth first order
