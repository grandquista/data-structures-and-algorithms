# Implement a singly linked list structure
Create a Python class that implements the methods of a list structure.

## Challenge
Implement the following methods.

- `insert` set a value as the start of the list before other nodes
- `insertAfter` insert a node with value after the first node containing key
- `insertBefore` insert a node with value before the first node containing key
- `append` set a value as a node at the end of the list
- `remove` taking a key and removing the first node that contains the key
- `kthFromEnd` taking an integer index and returning the node k from end of list
- `hasLoop` without arguments return if there is a loop in list links

Implement the following functions.

- `mergeLists` zip two lists together and return the new head
